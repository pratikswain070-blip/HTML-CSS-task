What does auto do in grid rows?
Auto means the row height changes based on how much content is inside. If there's more text, the row gets taller.

Which row grows based on content?
The row with auto grows based on content. 

Can rows have different heights?
Yes! One row can be 100px, another can be auto, another can be 200px. 

What happens if content is very large?
If we use a fixed height like 100px and content is bigger, the text overflows out of the box.

Where are grid rows useful in real layouts?
In website layouts like header, middle content, and footer. Each section can have its own height.
