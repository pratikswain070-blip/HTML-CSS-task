                <h2>What is the difference between a normal div and a grid container</h2>
                <p>A normal div stacks things one after another and grid container arrange items in rows and columns like a table.</p>

            </div>
            <div>
                <h2>Why does the layout look the same even after applying Grid?</h2>
                <p>Because we have not told how many rows and columns to be made. We said be a grid but didn't give it any rules to follow.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h2>Are grid items created automatically?</h2>
                <p>No, the items were already there as child divs. Grid just takes those items and arranges them differently.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h2>Can Grid work without rows or columns?</h2>
                <p>No becaue grid needs rows and columns to work without them, it is a normal container.</p>
            </div>
            <div>   
                <h2>What do you think Grid needs to show visible changes?</h2>
                <p>Grid needs us to tell it how many columns or rows to make.</p>
